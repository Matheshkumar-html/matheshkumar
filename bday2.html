  <h2>🔮 The Ancient Oracle</h2>
  <p>
    In the mountains of time, an oracle once saw your birth in the stars. 
    "This child," they proclaimed, "will bring laughter to the weeping, and courage to the unsure..."
    <br><br>
    Their name was <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong>, written in constellations.

  <h2>🌠 The Path of Light</h2>

  <p>
    From the moment <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong> took your first breath, a glow followed your every step.
    The universe gifted you with a heart that listens, a mind that wonders, and a spirit that shines.
    <br><br>
    In every corner you walk, shadows retreat. In every soul you touch, hope stirs.
    <strong class="nameDisplay">You</strong> are a bearer of light — not because you try, but because it’s who you are.
    <br><br>
    Where others see obstacles, you see opportunity. Where fear lives, you bring calm.
    The path you walk is not always easy... but it is bright, noble, and uniquely yours.

  <h2>⚔️ Trials & Triumphs</h2>
  <p>
    Life, as with all great legends, offered its share of storms.
    <strong class="nameDisplay">You</strong> faced them—not with fear, but with fierce determination.
    <br><br>
    There were days when the sky grew heavy and the winds howled loud,
    but even then, your spirit stood unshaken.
    Every tear became a pearl of wisdom. Every fall, a lesson. Every scar, a badge of honor.
    <br><br>
    Through uncertainty, <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong> walked with quiet strength.
    You did not merely survive—you evolved, rising like a phoenix with every trial.
    <br><br>
    And now, here you are: not just older, but braver. Not just wiser, but radiant.
    For every challenge you faced, the world was gifted a stronger you.

  <h2>🧙‍♂️ Companions of Destiny</h2>
  <p>
    No hero walks alone, and neither did <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong>.
    Through forests of joy and storms of sorrow, loyal hearts walked beside you—
    your companions of destiny.
    <br><br>
    Some wore cloaks of laughter, casting spells of joy on the darkest days.
    Others bore shields of wisdom, guiding you when the path seemed lost.
    A few simply held your hand—no magic, just love.
    <br><br>
    These were not just friends or family… they were kindred spirits chosen by the stars.
    Together, you formed a fellowship stronger than fate itself.
    <br><br>
    And even now, they gather—across time and space—to celebrate <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong>,
    the lightbearer, the dreamer, the one who never gave up.

  <h2>🪞 The Mirror of Wishes</h2>
  <p>
    Deep within the Temple of Dreams lies the Mirror of Wishes — a sacred glass that reveals the longing of one true heart.
    <br><br>
    As <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong> gaze into its shimmer, the stars fall silent.
    The winds pause, listening. The world leans closer.
    <br><br>
    Close your eyes now. Make your wish.
    Let it rise from your soul like stardust on the wind.
    For in this moment, the universe is yours — and the wish of <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong> echoes across eternity.

  <h2>🎁 The Gift of Stars</h2>
  <p>
    On this day, the cosmos delivers a gift not wrapped in ribbon, but in verse.
    A celestial poem for <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong>:
    <br><br>
    <em>
    You are the spark that stirs the skies,<br>
    A whisper kind, where courage lies.<br>
    A firefly in shadow’s grip,<br>
    A guiding star on every trip.<br>
    <br>
    So dance, dear soul, and claim your light,<br>
    For you were born to blaze the night.<br>
    On wings of joy, now rise and soar—<br>
    The world is yours forevermore.

    🌠 Happy Birthday, <strong class="nameDisplay">you</strong>.

    And so the tale reaches this page — not the end, but a pause.
    For destiny writes in seasons, and the next chapter is waiting, hidden in the stars.
    <br><br>
    Where will you go? What mysteries await? Only time will tell.
